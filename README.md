TODO:

DONE - 1. Create Proxy class and move marked functions.

2. Make cache sizes arguments to the Simulator when running.

3. Automate how sites are inspected (right now hardcoded for-loop): Want to be able to give specific sites as arguments and how many of them to compare \[SimulatorV2\].

4. Experiments with different cache sizes and chunk sizes (holding one fixed and changing the other param).

5. Experiments with 1 and multiple mobile devices and repeat task 4.

STARTED - 6. Make networked simulator \[SimulatorV3\].

7. Make Demo.

8. Write paper.

Order subject to change.
