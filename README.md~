Minimizing the required bandwidth for mobile web browsing
================

TODO:
1. Create Proxy class and move marked functions.
2. Make cache sizes arguments to the Simulator when running.
3. Automate how sites are inspected (right now hardcoded for-loop): Want to be able to give specific sites as arguments and how many of them to compare.
4. Experiments with different cache sizes and chunk sizes (holding one fixed and changing the other param).
5. Experiments with 1 and multiple mobile devices and repeat task 4.
6. Make networked simulator.
7. Make Demo.
8. Write paper.

Order subject to change.
