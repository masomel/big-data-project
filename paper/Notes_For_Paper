Notes For Paper:

assumptions
- mobile calculating fingerprints
- expiration
- cache - use of hashtable accurate?
- cache size
- chunking headers
- proxy should check its cache for "freshness" first.

- Ensuring freshness
- serve correct HTTP alternates
- objects that should not be cached

Ensuring freshness.
Proxy should check if the entry in its cache is fresh enough. 
	- expires or max-age header
	- last-modified/date header
	- checking absolute freshness limit
	- cache.config
- can modify aging factor for freshness computations
- can set absolute freshness limits
- can specify to cache only during header matches
Cache Control Headers:
- no-cache header, max-age header, min-fresh header, max-slate header
