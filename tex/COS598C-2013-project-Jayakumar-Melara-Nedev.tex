\begin{abstract}
The number of smartphones has been increasing in a very fast pace over the last several 
years. With this speed, it is quite likely that they will dominate the market in the very 
near future. As a result, the amount of mobile Web traffic now takes a serious portion of 
the total amount of Internet traffic. Moreover, it is expected to grow exponentially with 
every subsequent year. These facts put new challenges in the ways mobile networks are designed 
and built. New methods for alleviation of the amount of transmitted mobile web traffic data
should be found. 

In this paper, we propose a novel technique for reducing the needed bandwidth for mobile Web 
browsing. It automatically identifies redundancies in mobile Web sites data and cuts the number
of transimitted bytes. We leverage partitioning of website data into chunks and fingerprinting them
for efficient retrieval from a cache. The only addition to the network that our method requires 
is a dedicated proxy server which serves as a cache. We implement our techniques in a sophisticated 
simulator and evaluate their effectiveness on a number of popular websites. Our empirical results 
show that, with an appropriate tuning of all system components, the needed bandwidth can be reduced 
to less than 10\% in some cases.
