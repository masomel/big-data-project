\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have built a simulator to perform these analyses using use two datasets, one obtained by capturing HTTP response packets through the packet analysis tool Wireshark and the other obtained through telnet requests. 
Additionally, we have implemented a proof-of-concept networked mobile client simulator and basic proxy server showing that our technique does not require changes to web server configurations, and does not alter the mobile browsing experience, making this a viable enhancement to mobile browsers benefitting mobile users.
