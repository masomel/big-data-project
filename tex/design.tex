\section{System Design}
\label{sec:sys_design}
Our system is comprised of we add 
the following three steps: (1) Data Chunking which partitions incoming web content into fixed-size data chunks, (2) Fingerprinting which uses fingerprinting 
techniques to create a unique encoding of each unique data chunk, and (3) Caching which adds a layer on top of the web cache to only store unique chunks of data. 
We use a proxy server to perform the computationally intensive steps (1) and (2) to minimize the additional strain on the limited computational resources of mobile 
devices.
