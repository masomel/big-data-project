\subsection{Caching}
\label{sec:caching}
Another main component of our system are two caches - one in the proxy server and one in the 
mobile client. Each of them maintains a mapping between fingerprints and the chunks that they
represent. The fingerprint of each chunk is computed to retrieve the corresponding chunk from either one the caches. There
are no specific restrictions to the internal representation of the caches and their size.
