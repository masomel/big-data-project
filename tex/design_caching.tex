\subsection{Caching}
\label{sec:caching}
Another main component of our system are two caches - one in the proxy server and one in the 
mobile client. Each of them maintains a mapping between fingerprints and the chunks that they
represent. Each chunk is being fingerprinted and then requested from either of the caches. There
are no specific restrictions to the internal representation of the caches and their size, \textit{i.e.}
how they work internally is irrelevant to the way the other components of the system work.
