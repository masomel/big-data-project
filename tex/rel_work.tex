Some work has been done in trying to reduce bandwidth in wide-area networks. Ihm \textit{et al.}~\cite{wanax} present 
a system for reducing bandwidth in wide-area networks for efficient Internet usage in developing countries. Their 
technique is similar to the one used in this work, \textit{e.g.} chunking of the stream of data and Rabin fingerprinting 
of the resulting chunks. However, they are assuming large and small  

Ihm and Pai~\cite{modern_web_traffic} perform a thorough and deep analysis of Web traffic logs that have been collected 
over five-years period. They find many interesting facts about connection speed of today's Web users, NAT usage, content type
of the traffic and the traffic share of different types of Web sites. Moreover, they find that there is a fair amount 
of redundancy in the Web traffic and discuss different approaches for reducing the amount of this redundancy.
