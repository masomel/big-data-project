\section{Related Work}

Trellis \cite{trellis} is similar to MiniNet \cite{lantz} in that it use
container-based virtualization. It does not, however, use processes as the
abstraction for virtual hosts. It is similar to our work because it uses GRE
tunneling to connect multiple physical machines, except with a custom
implementation the authors call Ethernet GRE. It is likely they implemented
ethernet over GRE themselves because the equivalent gretap mechanism we use in
the Linux kernel was not available to them at the time. Mininet with our code
offers similar functionality as Trellis except that Trellis is a bit more
heavyweight, not geared for OpenFlow, and doesn't provide as easy a path to
deployment.

Emulab \cite{emulab} offers a virtualized topology on which experiments can be
run. The authors implement their own version of virtual Ethernet interfaces
(veth). The paper does not discuss GRE tunneling and uses FreeBSD jails instead
of Linux containers to give each host its own network namespace. Emulab's
design goals are substantially different than Mininet's, but use similar
techniques to accomplish them.

IMUNES \cite{imunes} modifies FreeBSD to allow for multiple, simultaneous
network stacks to exist within the kernel. Processes are isolated from others
on their own network stacks. IMUNES's functionality is also similar to Mininet,
but it does not offer the ability to hook up virtual hosts to those on other
physical machines like we do with GRE tunneling.

Crossbow Virtual Wire \cite{crossbow} is not an emulator, but is somewhat
similar to Mininet because it is another framework that uses lightweight
virtualization.  Crossbow uses OpenSolaris Zones which are similar to Linux
containers and FreeBSD jails to isolate its network entities.
